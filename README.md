Windows are a significant source of heat loss in buildings, contributing to increased energy
consumption. Existing solutions like double-glazing and low-emissivity coatings either
compromise natural lighting or remain costly. This research proposes a hybrid system
integrating transparent silica aerogels with phase-change materials (PCMs) to minimize heat
loss without affecting light transmission. The aerogel's low thermal conductivity combined
with PCM's heat storage capability ensures improved thermal efficiency, maintaining indoor
comfort while reducing energy costs.
